1: Installing Money 2006 Requires Hard Disk Space On Windows Drive

When you install Money 2006, Money requires that you install 
Internet Explorer 6.0 SP1, if it is not already on your computer. 
This requires up to 60 MB of disk space on the drive where Windows is 
installed. After installing Internet Explorer, you can choose 
the drive on which you want to install Money 2006. 

NOTE: If you already have Internet Explorer 6.0 SP1, 
installing Money 2006 will require less space.

__________________________________________________________________   

2: Running Money 2006 And Earlier Versions Of Money On The Same Computer 

In general, Money has limited support for a side-by-side installation of 
Money 2006 with earlier versions of Money. Before installing Money 2006, make 
sure you have the CD or installation source for the previous version available. If 
you want to use Money 2006 while also using another version of Money, 
please read the following:


A.  To install Money 2006 on the same computer with Money 2005:

Note: If Money 2005 is installed on your computer, the default installation 
folder is C:\Program Files\Microsoft Money 2005.

1.  Install Money 2006 in a different folder than the earlier 
version of Money.
2.  Make a copy of your Money 2005 data file.
3.  Click the Microsoft Money 2006 Start menu icon to start Money 2006.

Money creates a backup file named MyMoney.m14 (if your data file is named 
MyMoney.mny) and Money upgrades your data file. You now have two backup files 
you can use in Money 2005 if you choose. In addition to the copy you made 
in step 2, you have the MyMoney.m14 file that you can open or copy and rename.


B.  To install Money 2006 on the same computer with Money 2004:

Note: If Money 2004 is installed on your computer, the default installation 
folder is c:\Program Files\Microsoft Money.

1.  Install Money 2006 in a different folder than the earlier 
version of Money.
2.  Make a copy of your Money 2004 data file.
3.  Click the Microsoft Money 2006 Start menu icon to start Money 2006.

Money creates a backup file named MyMoney.m12 (if your data file is named 
MyMoney.mny) and Money upgrades your data file. You now have two backup files 
you can use in Money 2004 if you choose. In addition to the copy you made 
in step 2, you have the MyMoney.m12 file that you can open or copy and rename.

C.  To use the earlier version of Money, e.g. Money 2004:

The first time you start Money 2004 after installing Money 2006: 

1.  Click the Microsoft Money 2004 Start menu icon to start Money 2004.
2.  When the Password dialog box appears, click Cancel.
3.  Click OK.
4.  In the Open a File dialog box, select the Open/Work with an existing Money 
    file option, and then click Next.
5.  Browse to the Money backup file created by Money 2006 (e.g. My Money.m12).
6.  Select this file and click Open.


Once you have associated a Money data file with each version of Money, you can start the 
version you want by clicking the appropriate Start menu icon.

C.  To uninstall Money:

1.  Use Add and Remove Programs to uninstall the version of Money you want to remove.
2.  If you uninstall either version, you may have to reinstall the version remaining on 
    your computer.  Make sure you have the original installation CD before uninstalling 
    either version.

D.  Other Notes:

1.  Do not double-click files to open Money.  Use the desktop icons or the Start menu 
    shortcuts, so you know which version you are opening. You will need to associate the 
    Money files with the correct version of Money first. Otherwise, you will get the 
    password dialog box when the older version of Money tries to open an upgraded file.
2.  You cannot use different versions of Money for the same Money data file.
3.  You cannot run both versions of Money at the same time.
4.  Microsoft will not support more than two versions of Money installed at one time.

__________________________________________________________________ 

3: Money Not Compatible With Beta Versions of Operating Systems or 
Beta Versions of Internet Explorer 

Please upgrade to the released version of your operating system or 
Internet Explorer before using Money.

__________________________________________________________________   

4: Installing Money 2006 on Computers with Anti-Virus Services.

Some anti-virus services may interfere with Microsoft Money setup.  You may want to
turn off any anti-virus services before installing Money.  Be sure to turn it back on 
when Money setup is complete.

__________________________________________________________________   

5: File Size And Money 2006

The file format used by Money 2006 lets the Money team create 
powerful features such as Advisor FYI, the Lifetime Planner, 
and the Monthly Report (all available for Deluxe users). You might 
notice that your converted Money 2006 file is bigger than your old 
Money file. 

However, you'll find that Money's compressed backup files are much smaller 
than your regular file. So if you need to take your data file to 
another computer, use the File/Backup command.

__________________________________________________________________   

6: Internet Connections Require WinSock-Compliant ISP 

Money 2006 allows you to make many connections to the Internet to 
gather information and advice about your finances. To connect to 
the Internet, you need an Internet service provider (ISP) that 
works directly with the 32-bit WinSock included with Windows 98, 
Windows 2000, Windows ME, and Windows XP. 

Most full-service Internet providers (those not requiring custom 
software to access their service) will support the 32-bit WinSock. 
If you have questions about your Internet connection 
compatibility, ask your ISP if it supports the Windows 32-bit 
WinSock. 

__________________________________________________________________   

7: Restart Windows After Upgrading Internet Service Provider (ISP)

If you install new software from your ISP, you should restart 
Windows before attempting to make an Internet connection in Money. 
Failure to restart after upgrading your ISP software may cause 
miscellaneous errors in Money 2006.

__________________________________________________________________   

8: Internet Explorer Security Settings

The following security settings are recommended when making 
Internet connections in Money.

1. On the Tools menu in Money, click Settings, and then click Browser settings. 

2. Click Connection Settings.

3. On the Security tab, select the Internet zone (globe icon) 

4. In the Security level for this zone area, click Default Level, and then 
move the slider to Medium (most secure).

Note: Internet Explorer 6.0 SP1 or later is required to run 
Money, but Money still allows you to use your default browser.

__________________________________________________________________   

9: Internet Options May Cause Money 2006 Areas To Wash Out 

If you modify your Internet Explorer Multimedia settings and clear 
the Show Pictures check box, several places in Money may appear 
"washed out" and the text may be unreadable. Follow these steps to 
resolve the problem:

1. On the Tools menu, click Connection Settings.

2. Click the Advanced tab.

3. Scroll down until you see the Multimedia section.

4. Check the Show pictures box.

__________________________________________________________________   

10: Money 2006 On Windows 98 Stops Responding If Modem Not Plugged In To Phone Line

Money may stop responding in the Initializing and Contacting Server portion 
of the Call Progress dialog box. This occurs if you are using 
Windows 98 and try to make a direct modem connection in Money 2006 
while the modem is not connected to a phone line. You cannot use 
any other Windows 98 modem application.

The solution is to restart Windows and make sure that the modem 
is plugged in to the phone line before attempting to make a direct 
modem connection.

__________________________________________________________________   

11: Windows 98 Issues with U.S. Robotics ISDN Modem and Regular Modem

If you are using Windows 98 and have a U.S. Robotics 128k ISDN 
adapter installed, Money 2006 may stop responding or return the following 
error message when you try to connect to your online banking 
service provider:

   Money could not complete the call due to a problem with your 
   modem installation.

For information on how to troubleshoot this error, refer to the 
Microsoft Knowledge Base article, "Money: Online Banking Hangs 
with U.S. Robotics ISDN Adapter Installed." This article is 
available at http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/q160/0/51.asp.

__________________________________________________________________   

12: Disable Remote WinSock If You Dial Up Directly To The Internet

If you are establishing dial-up connections directly to the 
Internet (using an Internet service provider or a dial-up connection 
through MSN), you need to disable Remote WinSock. You may not need 
to disable Remote WinSock if you are dialing into a LAN or using a 
corporate intranet. Consult your network administrator.

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.
2. Double-click WinSock Proxy Client.
3. Clear the Enable WinSock Proxy Client check box.

__________________________________________________________________   

13: Printer Drivers 
 
If you experience problems printing in Money 2006, you should get 
an updated driver from the printer manufacturer. This is often the 
first step in troubleshooting printing problems.

__________________________________________________________________   

14: Printing Partial Sheets Of Checks On Sheet Feed Printers
 
Money defines a partial sheet of checks as when you have removed 
at least one of the checks from a single sheet prior to loading 
the sheet of checks into the printer. Money prints partial sheets 
of checks in landscape mode. (This orientation is similar to how 
you print an envelope.)

Printing partial sheets of checks (single-sheet style) is not 
supported by all laser or inkjet printers. Due to the feed 
mechanisms of some printers, it is difficult to align and print on 
partial sheets of checks. 

The following printers have been tested and shown to have problems
printing partial sheets of checks in Money:
   
   Apple Color LW 12/660
   Canon Bubble-Jet BJC 4550
   Canon Bubble-Jet BJC-610
   Epson Stylus 1520
   Epson Stylus 800
   Epson Stylus Color Esc/P 2
   HP Color Laser Jet 5
   HP LaserJet 5000
   HP LaserJet 6P
   HP LaserJet Indra
   HP LaserJet 4MV
   IBM 4019 Laser Printer
   Lexmark ExecJet IIC 4076
   Tektronix Phaser 360

If your printer has difficulty feeding partial sheets of checks in landscape 
mode, you can order Laser Voucher checks that never have partial 
sheets. You can also print Laser Standard or Laser Wallet checks 
in batches of three. 

Depending on the feed mechanism of the printer, the following 
method might work to feed partial check sheets: 

1. Load the partial sheet into the printer as if it were a full 
   sheet. Push the sheet all the way into the tray. 

2. On the File menu, click Print Checks. 

3. Verify that the number of checks to print equals the number of 
   checks remaining on your partial sheet. If the number of checks 
   to print is incorrect, follow these steps: 

   a. Click Selected Checks. 

   b. Select up to the number of checks remaining on the partial 
      sheet. 

   c. Click OK. 

4. Make sure to enter the correct check number for the first 
   check. 

5. In answer to the question "How many checks are on the first 
   page?", click Three. This causes Money to print in portrait 
   orientation.

15: Requirements for the Tour and Instructional Videos

 - The Money Tour is not available in all versions of Money. It is
   not available if you downloaded the Trial version of Money 2006 
   from the Web or a CD Trial version. If Money came pre-installed 
   on your computer, it may or may not be available, depending on 
   the version of Money installed by your computer manufacturer. 

 - To view the videos, you must have Internet Explorer 6.0 and the
   Macromedia Flash player installed. Money installs Internet Explorer 6.0 automatically
   when you install Money, but only if you have not installed Internet Explorer 6.0
   or a later version already. Flash is installed along with Internet Explorer 6.0.

 - If you have Internet Explorer 6.0 or later but have removed Flash from your computer, 
   Money 2006 does not install Flash automatically. You can download Flash 
   from this website: http://www.macromedia.com/software/flash/

 - If you have manually removed Internet Explorer, you'll need to reinstall it.
   You can do so by running the IE6setup.exe program from the IE folder 
   on the Money CD-ROM.

 - Your Internet Explorer security settings should be set to the 
   default of Medium or lower to run the Tours for the first 
   time.

 - The videos included with Money are best experienced when your speakers are 
   turned on and the volume is set appropriately.

____________________________________________________________   

16: Display Color Settings
 
While Money 2006 contains some color scheme options that may work 
in 16-color mode, Money 2006 was designed to work in 256-color 
mode or higher.

The Money 2006 multimedia tours and Help videos are designed to 
work in 256-color mode or higher. If you run these in 16-color 
mode, the tours and videos may run slowly or may be illegible. For 
this reason, it is highly recommended that the tour and videos 
never be run using 256-color mode or higher.

To check or change your color mode, follow these steps:

1. Click Start on the Windows taskbar, point to Settings, and then click 
   Control Panel.

2. Double-click Display.

3. Click the Settings tab.

4. Check the Color Palette setting to see which mode your computer 
   is running in. If your video card supports 256 colors, you'll 
   see that option in the Color Palette drop-down list.

5. Choose 256 Color from the list, and then click OK. 
   Windows will ask if you want to restart your computer so the 
   change can take effect.  Click Yes.

17: How To Obtain the Euro Currency Symbol

If you enable Money 2006 to use Euro currency, Money may not 
correctly display the Euro currency symbol. For more information 
on this issue, refer to the Microsoft Knowledge Base article, 
"Money 2002: How to Obtain the Euro Symbol." This article is 
available at 
http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/q156/1/81.asp. 

__________________________________________________________________   

18: Quicken Versions Supported By The Quicken Conversion Wizard

Money can convert data files from Quicken versions 4, 5, 6, 7,
8, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13 (Quicken 2004). 

_________________________________________________________________   
 
19: Canadian Users of Money 2006 Standard Need to Use Canadian Settings

Attention Canadian Users of Money 2006 Standard: If you create a new file in 
Money 2006, it’s important that you run Money with Canadian settings before 
creating the new file, in order to start with the appropriate set of default 
categories.  If you are already using Money, you will know you are using U.S. 
Settings if you have a Taxes menu in the navigation bar across the top of the 
screen.  (See below for more information on Canadian Taxes.)  
Please refer to Help for more information on 
how to switch to Canadian Settings.  Make sure that you click File, point to New, 
and then click New File to create a new file after switching to Canadian Settings.  

To obtain Canadian Tax functionality:

1. click Banking.  

2. On the Account Tools menu, click Categories & Payees. 

3. To select the Tax Forms and Tax Lines that are associated with each category, in 
   the left pane, click Set up tax categories. 
  
When you are ready to do your taxes, click Export to Tax Software on the File menu.

____________________________________________________________________   

20: Electronic Payments are Entered into the Account Register Using the Process Date
 
Money 2006 enters electronic payments into the account register using the 
process date. After this date, payments can no longer be canceled. However, the 
funds may not be withdrawn on this date, depending on the payment method used by your 
financial institution or bill payment provider.
 
If you would prefer not to have Money use the processing date for entering 
scheduled electronic payments into the account register, do the following:
1. On the Tools menu, click Settings.
2. Click Online service settings.
3. Clear the "Enter electronic payments in the register with the processing date" check box.
4. Click OK. 
All future payments scheduled by your financial institution or bill payment provider 
will show in the account register with either the due date, or the date that funds were 
withdrawn from your account, whichever is earlier.
 
 
Note: This date may be later than the date when a payment may be canceled. To see the 
processing date, right-click the payment and select Payment Status. The processing 
date will be displayed. Unchecking this option does not change the date of previous 
transactions.

____________________________________________________________________   

21: Money for Pocket PC Requires Upgrade to Money 2006 for Pocket PC

If you use Money for Pocket PC and synchronize it with your desktop Money file, 
you need to upgrade Money for Pocket PC so that it will work correctly with desktop
Money 2006.

Note: you may also need to upgrade your Pocket PC operating system. Money for
Pocket PC will only run on the Pocket PC 2002 & 2003 operating systems. To upgrade, contact
the manufacturer of your device.

____________________________________________________________________   

22: MSN Money Synchronization Does Not Include Credit Card Bills Categorized as       
    Transfers

In Money 2006, you can see your bills and deposits online if you use MSN Money
Synchronization.  Many people categorize credit card bills as transfers from one account to 
another.  MSN Money Synchronization does not include transfers so while you will see credit 
card bills, investment purchase bills, or any other bills or deposits that you have categorized 
as transfers, they will not be categorized as transfers on the MSN Money website.

____________________________________________________________________   

23: Important Information about Online Services


In Money 2001 and earlier versions, some financial institutions used an older
format to exchange data. These financial institutions are listed below. (If your
bank is not on the list, your services will not be affected, and you can disregard
this section).

In Money 2006, all of the institutions listed below are upgrading to the newest
data exchange format called OFX.  This upgrade will occur when you accept an
online service update from the financial institution. The upgrade is necessary
if you are upgrading from Money 2001 or earlier and if you want to use direct 
connection services with your bank or brokerage in Money 2006. 

Note: If you do accept this upgrade in Money 2006 you will be unable to continue 
using direct services in Money 2001 with this bank.

28: GainsKeeper Data Display Requires Java Virtual Machine
 
The GainsKeeper site uses a Java applet to display your portfolio data. Java applets are 
run by your browser's Java Virtual Machine. If you see a blank rectangle or an error 
message saying "Java applet can't initialize,"  your browser may not have Java features 
enabled, or Java may not be installed.

To enable Java features in your browser, check your browser settings. Steps for this 
vary. In Internet Explorer 6.0, on the Tools menu, click Internet Options, and then click the 
Advanced tab. Scroll down to Microsoft VM, and select the check box for "JIT compiler for 
virtual machine enabled." 

If the Microsoft VM options are not present, you can download the Java Runtime Environment 
from: http://javashoplm.sun.com/ECom/docs/Welcome.jsp?StoreId=22&PartDetailId=j2re-1.4.2_08-oth-JPR&SiteId=JSC&TransactionId=noreg. 
If your computer does not use Windows XP, you can download the JRE software from GainsKeeper 
by going to https://money.gainskeeper.com/ab_faq.aspx?#jvm.

After you install the Java Runtime Environment, on the Internet Explorer Tools menu, click 
Internet Options, and then click the Advanced tab. Find the Java submenu options and select 
the check box with text similar to: “Use Java 2 <version> for <applet> (requires restart).”

29: Problems Installing When My Documents Folder Is Redirected to Network Share

Users who redirect their My Documents folder to a shared network directory may be unable
to install Money 2006 when their computer is disconnected from the network. Money uses
My Documents as its default location for user data files. Although users can specify
a different location, Money may freeze while attempting to find the My Documents folder
during initial installation. The solution is to restore the network connection.
